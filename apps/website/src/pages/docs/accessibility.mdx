## Metadata

Applications should set the [`lang` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang) on the `<html>` element. This can be done from the application entrypoint (whether that's a plain HTML file or a JSX root layout).

```html
<html lang="en">
```

Every page must have a unique `<title>` that identifies the page. For example, the application's home page might have the title "Home — Acme Application", and a projects page might have the title "Projects — Acme Application".

```html
<title>{pageName} — {applicationName}</title>
```

### Single-page applications

When working with single-page applications, setting the title might require using your framework's built-in metadata API, or a third-party library like [`react-helmet`](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).

When navigating between pages on a regular website, screen-readers will automatically announce the page title. Within a single-page application, you might need to use a [live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) to emulate the same functionality. Some frameworks come with a [built-in route announcer](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/accessibility#route-announcements), while others might require implementing this manually.

## Landmarks

[Landmarks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/landmarks/) are a set of eight roles that identify the major sections of a page. Landmarks allow assistive technology users to quickly browse and skip to relevant content.

The main content of the page must be wrapped in a `<main>` element. This works well when combined with iTwinUI's [`<Header>`](/docs/header), [`<SideNavigation>`](/docs/sidenavigation), and [`<Footer>`](/docs/footer) components.

```jsx
<Header>…</Header>
<SideNavigation>…</SideNavigation>
<main>…</main>
<Footer />
```

iTwinUI also provides an [iTwinUI-layouts package](https://itwin.github.io/iTwinUI-layouts/) which automatically sets up these landmarks.

## Headings

[Headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/) communicate the organization of the page content. Assistive technology users rely on headings, in addition to landmarks, to navigate and understand the page.

- Every page must have one `<h1>` element that identifies the page.
  - This heading often coincides with the page title.
- Every major section of the page might contain an `<h2>` element.
- Sub-sections of the major sections might be identified with `<h3>`.

It is important not to skip heading levels (e.g. going from `<h2>` to `<h4>`). iTwinUI's [`<Text>`](typography) component decouples the heading's visual presentation from its semantics, which helps ensure that a proper heading structured can be utilized regardless of the desired visuals.

In some cases, a page might not have an obvious candidate to be used as the `<h1>`. Since every page is required to have an `<h1>`, this heading can be rendered as [`<VisuallyHidden>`](/docs/visuallyhidden) to maintain a sensible heading structure without impacting visuals.

```jsx
<VisuallyHidden as='h1'>Projects</VisuallyHidden>
```
